After a long day at the office and the possible sighting of an inspiring New York City sunset, she unwinds at home with an activity that deliberately takes care of her mental, emotional, spiritual, and physical health. To set the mood, she ignites her candlelight and shares the scent of notes and a warm light sure to ease the day. \\n\\n\nHer concept and passion for creating meaningful self-care candles’ came about early in quarantine, After COVID (A.C) 2020. Tapping into her creative flow didn’t come easy while experiencing NYC’s first shutdown & quarantine solo. This, however, presented the purpose needed to find her new light through unprecedented times. In turn, her storytelling through each collection reminds us that together we can accomplish more good in a world in need of healing and more than a self-care day. \\n\\n\nShe aspires to be your favorite- go-to Chandler with each candle collection she hand pours with mindful ingredients and your story. Each collection brings meaning created through your activity, which wildly differs from her grandparents' days of Candlemaking. As a third-generation in Candlemaking, lighting a candle takes on a new meaning in holding a light in your space. Her grandparents’ candles provided light for when their electricity back home in the Dominican Republic would go out. Their community used candles for everyday essentials, and tillallhours Candle Co. also wants our community to enjoy a day's moment with your light.\n","image_2":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"aspectRatio":1.25,"src":"/static/3e2ee7544635a45138c932ae0c11c55c/14b42/8cdfadb0-879b-4bd4-a1ff-405b2aabd622.jpg","srcSet":"/static/3e2ee7544635a45138c932ae0c11c55c/f836f/8cdfadb0-879b-4bd4-a1ff-405b2aabd622.jpg 200w,\n/static/3e2ee7544635a45138c932ae0c11c55c/2244e/8cdfadb0-879b-4bd4-a1ff-405b2aabd622.jpg 400w,\n/static/3e2ee7544635a45138c932ae0c11c55c/14b42/8cdfadb0-879b-4bd4-a1ff-405b2aabd622.jpg 800w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}},"image_3":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.78125,"src":"/static/ca2ee763d89a50433d286b89a21c4f8b/14b42/d070b95d-26fb-4083-9d57-f74731797be0.jpg","srcSet":"/static/ca2ee763d89a50433d286b89a21c4f8b/f836f/d070b95d-26fb-4083-9d57-f74731797be0.jpg 200w,\n/static/ca2ee763d89a50433d286b89a21c4f8b/2244e/d070b95d-26fb-4083-9d57-f74731797be0.jpg 400w,\n/static/ca2ee763d89a50433d286b89a21c4f8b/14b42/d070b95d-26fb-4083-9d57-f74731797be0.jpg 800w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}},"image_4":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.8,"src":"/static/b28d358d12dc94d4e7631f74815518fd/14b42/386b8f77-c36f-4b4f-b3bf-3b6989e3f8b4.jpg","srcSet":"/static/b28d358d12dc94d4e7631f74815518fd/f836f/386b8f77-c36f-4b4f-b3bf-3b6989e3f8b4.jpg 200w,\n/static/b28d358d12dc94d4e7631f74815518fd/2244e/386b8f77-c36f-4b4f-b3bf-3b6989e3f8b4.jpg 400w,\n/static/b28d358d12dc94d4e7631f74815518fd/14b42/386b8f77-c36f-4b4f-b3bf-3b6989e3f8b4.jpg 800w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}},"image_5":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"aspectRatio":1.5037593984962405,"src":"/static/1f981ecfd6f935320395b6466d7126d1/14b42/97f95a93-1524-4a59-adbc-209bc11d3a92.jpg","srcSet":"/static/1f981ecfd6f935320395b6466d7126d1/f836f/97f95a93-1524-4a59-adbc-209bc11d3a92.jpg 200w,\n/static/1f981ecfd6f935320395b6466d7126d1/2244e/97f95a93-1524-4a59-adbc-209bc11d3a92.jpg 400w,\n/static/1f981ecfd6f935320395b6466d7126d1/14b42/97f95a93-1524-4a59-adbc-209bc11d3a92.jpg 800w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}}]}}}
