(2)Allow for a good first burn\nThe first burn of the candle is the most important. In the first burn, allow for the melted wax pool to reach the edge of the jar; otherwise, tunneling will occur. Lastly, keep burning candles away from AC vents and fans because the draft will not allow the candle to burn evenly and can become hazardous.\n###### (3)Don’t burn too much\nDo not burn for more than 2-4 hours (depending on the size of candle) every 24 hours is the rule of thumb when burning your candle.\n###### (4)Keep the candle clean\nTry to avoid letting the candle jar get dirty or this will affect the burn. Avoid using cleaning products because this could interact with the fragrance oils and lead to a bad smelling candle.","body":"###### (1)Trim the wick\nTrimming the wick to about a ¼ inch allows for a better clean burn and doesn’t lead to the flames blackening the glass of your jar.\n###### (2)Allow for a good first burn\nThe first burn of the candle is the most important.
