(2)Allow for a good first burn\nThe first burn of the candle is the most important. In the first burn, allow for the melted wax pool to reach the edge of the jar; otherwise, tunneling will occur. Lastly, keep burning candles away from AC vents and fans because the draft will not allow the candle to burn evenly and can become hazardous.\n###### (3)Don’t burn too much\nDo not burn for more than 2-4 hours (depending on the size of candle) every 24 hours is the rule of thumb when burning your candle.\n###### (4)Keep the candle clean\nTry to avoid letting the candle jar get dirty or this will affect the burn.
